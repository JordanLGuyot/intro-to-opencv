# OpenCV tutorial
OpenCV is a toolkit for processing computer imagery. This tutorial covers some common jobs you can do using openCV. But first, a bit of context. OpenCV is NOT machine learning; instead, it is a series of algorithms made by humans that do certain tasks. They are not perfect, and you, as another human, have to make the most of them. Additionally, since OpenCV is a toolkit, it is not applicable in every scenario. 

What does this repository help you do? It assumes you have a windows/linux/macbook and know nothing except how to click stuff and type stuff. It will help you understand how to solve certain problems. Let's get started!

## Installing OpenCV
1. Install python. If you need step by step instructions doing this, check out our python tutorial: https://github.com/usydroboticsclub/python
2. Learn python. If you need step by step instructions doing this, check out our python tutorial: https://github.com/usydroboticsclub/python; and our other python tutorial: https://github.com/usydroboticsclub/py_harder
3. Open a command shell. All platforms have a command shell. If you're on windows, click the start menu and type CMD, then press enter. If you're on mac, go to launcher and type in Terminal. If you're on linux, press your equivalent of a start button and type in terminal.
4. Type in `pip3 install opencv-python` and press enter. You many have to wait a bit. 
5. Hooray! You now have opencv on your computer.

Download this repository by clicking the big green 'Code' button towards the top of the page, followed by 'Download Zip'.
